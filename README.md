# StonePaperScissor
A java project of Stone, paper, Scissor game of 4  players.
In this project the stone , paper and scissor, firstly, we assume them as 1,2 and  respectively and then working upon them accordingly.
Spring is used to reduce dependency.
In the FinalResult.java there are lot of comments. This is done intentionally so that by uncommenting those comments you can easily understand the flow of the program and also it easier to understand.
Finally, In test.java main method is available and you can easily run this this project by this way.
Thanks.
